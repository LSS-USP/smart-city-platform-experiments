## IoTAbench

> Created by HPE, provides a scalable synthetic generator of time-series datasets.
> The benchmark includes six SQL queries to evaluate the performance of different
> query platforms on the generated dataset.

## CityBench

> Benchmark to evaluate RDF stream processing systems. Include generation
> patterns for smart city data (traffic, vehicles, parking, weather, ...)
> with changing event rates and playback speeds. Could be used for RDF databases
